    <p>My name is Alex Simuro. I am 18 years old. I am 5 feet and 11 inches tall and weigh 150 pounds. In the Spring semester, I will be attending Boston University.</p>
    <p> I have been a sports fan since I can remember. My favorite teams are the Washingon Capitals, Arsenal, and the Lakers.
        Growing up I played hockey, soccer, and basketball.  Next year when I am eligible to play, I am planning to try and walk on to the D1 team at Boston University. If that doesn't work out I would be happy to play on the club team there.  </p>
    <p>I am 50% italian, so obviously my favorite foods are pasta and pizza. However, I also am a huge fan of mexican food. Chipotle is my favorite food chain, followed by Chik-fil-a.  </p>
